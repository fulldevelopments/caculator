My second react-native application using function.

Necessary to install android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/install?hl=en

To run it is necessary to be inside the calculator folder with the command npx react-native run-android to emulate with android studio.

In the app you inform how many numbers you want to generate and right after click on generate to get the amount generated randomly.
